Importance Score: 85/100

The AI opponent system implements poker-specific decision making through three core components:

## Hand Strength Evaluation
Located in `src/lib/poker/handEvaluator.ts`
- Calculates relative hand strength on 0-1 scale
- Evaluates current holding against possible opponent hands
- Integrates kicker-based tiebreakers for accurate strength assessment

## Risk Assessment Engine
Located in `src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts`
- Processes hand strength data to determine optimal actions
- Implements progressive difficulty scaling
- Factors pot size and betting patterns into decisions

## Strategic Decision Making
Located in `src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts`
- Pot odds calculation for bet/call decisions
- Basic bluffing mechanics based on hand strength
- Risk-adjusted betting patterns
- Progressive difficulty adaptation based on hand evaluation results

Key Business Rules:
1. Decision making weighted by pot odds calculation
2. Bluffing frequency tied to hand strength assessment
3. Progressive difficulty scaling impacts risk tolerance
4. Strategy adjusts based on betting round (small/big bet periods)
