# ai-decision-system

The AI decision system operates through a specialized engine in `src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts` with an importance score of 85/100. The system integrates three core decision-making components:

## Hand Strength Evaluation
- Analyzes current hand value using custom algorithms
- Integrates with `handEvaluator.ts` for precise strength calculations
- Determines relative position strength against potential opponent hands

## Risk Assessment
- Calculates pot odds for informed betting decisions
- Evaluates risk/reward ratio for each action
- Factors in current pot size and required bet amount

## Strategic Decision Engine
- Implements probabilistic bluffing system
- Determines optimal actions (bet/check/fold)
- Dynamically sizes bets based on:
  - Current hand strength
  - Pot size
  - Previous betting patterns
  - Risk assessment results

## Betting Logic
- Variable bet sizing based on hand strength evaluation
- Strategic bet amount calculation considering pot odds
- Bluffing frequency adjusted by game context
- Progressive betting patterns to maximize value

The system relies on hand evaluation data from `handEvaluator.ts` (95/100 importance) to make informed decisions about gameplay actions and betting strategies.
