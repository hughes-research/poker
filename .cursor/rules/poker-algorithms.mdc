## Hand Evaluation System (95/100)
`src/lib/poker/handEvaluator.ts`
- Poker hand ranking evaluation with complete hierarchy implementation
- Specialized scoring system calculating relative hand strength on 0-1 scale
- Tiebreaker resolution using kicker cards
- Wheel straight detection (A-2-3-4-5)

## Game Engine Logic (90/100)
`src/lib/poker/gameLogic.ts`
- 5-card draw poker implementation with four distinct phases:
  - DEALING
  - BETTING
  - DRAWING
  - SHOWDOWN
- Fixed-limit betting structure enforcement
- Pot management and chip distribution rules
- Action validation for player turns

## AI Decision Engine (85/100)
`src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts`
- Risk assessment algorithms based on calculated hand strength
- Pot odds calculation for bet/fold decisions
- Bluffing mechanics integration
- Difficulty scaling tied to hand evaluation results

## Game State Rules (80/100)
`src/store/gameStore.ts`
- Match progression tracking to 100 points
- Betting round coordination
- Draw phase card selection management
- Game history tracking
- Progressive match scoring implementation

## Core Business Rules
- Fixed betting structure with defined small/big bet amounts
- Single draw phase in 5-card draw format
- Standard poker hand rankings
- Progressive scoring to 100 points
- AI decisions based on hand strength and pot odds calculations
