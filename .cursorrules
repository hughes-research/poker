## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Game Components

The poker game system consists of four primary business logic components that handle game rules, hand evaluation, AI decisions, and state management.

## Hand Evaluation System (95/100)
Located in `src/lib/poker/handEvaluator.ts`, this component:
- Determines poker hand strengths and rankings
- Identifies card combinations (pairs, straights, flushes)
- Implements hand comparison logic
- Calculates tie-breaking values

## Game Rules Engine (90/100)
Implemented in `src/lib/poker/gameLogic.ts`, managing:
- Betting round progression
- Turn-based gameplay flow
- Pot and chip distribution
- Game progression (deal → bet → draw → bet → showdown)

## AI Decision Engine (85/100)
The `src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts` system provides:
- Hand strength evaluation
- Risk assessment using pot odds
- Strategic betting decisions
- Probabilistic bluffing mechanics
- Dynamic bet sizing

## State Management (80/100)
`src/store/gameStore.ts` handles:
- Match scoring (first to 100 points)
- Round progression tracking
- Fixed-limit betting implementation
- Game history recording
- Player interaction rules
