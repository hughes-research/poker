## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The poker game system implements a complete 5-card draw poker environment with an AI opponent, structured around four primary business components:

- Specialized handling of wheel straights (A-2-3-4-5)
- Hand strength scoring on 0-1 scale
- Tiebreaker resolution with kicker cards

## AI Decision Making (Importance: 85/100)
Located at `src/lib/poker/aiOpponent.ts`:
- Risk assessment based on hand evaluation
- Pot odds calculations
- Bluffing mechanism implementation
- Difficulty scaling system

## Game State Control (Importance: 80/100)
Located at `src/store/gameStore.ts`:
- Match progression to 100 points
